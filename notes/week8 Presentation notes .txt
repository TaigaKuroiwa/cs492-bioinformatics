week8 Presentation notes 

Fuzzy Vault Crypto Biometric Key Based on Fingerprint Vector Features - Bryan
putting cryptology on finger prints

The idea itself is out there - but not much consistent models yet
lowmemory and storage-> so 1to1 matching = not much security = you can brute force in

distortion tolerance and discrimination requirements
biometrics = being able to read biology

fuzzy commitment = 200 chalking information so its harder to brute force
chalking = put fake bioprints 
1 right answer and then apply fake information -> will cause false readings too
brute force = if somebody breakin, there will be too many information 

more components = fuzy vault scheme
it provided little bit more security, but did not solve anymore issues

false acceptance = you actually need to register 
false rejection rate - instance of a secruity system failing to verify or identify
an authorized person = likelihood that the biometric security system will 
incorrectly reject an access attempt by an authorized user 


Recursive Training of 2D-3D Convolutional Networks　for Neuronal Boundary Detection　- Gus

neural network 
two nodes, input layer -> hidden layer(s) -> weight+activation -> output layer 
This is basic structure + one dimentional computation of neural network 

Convolutional neural networks -> kind off similar to neocognitron
http://www.kiv.zcu.cz/studies/predmety/uir/NS/Neocognitron/en/images/figure3-1.gif
200 x 200 x 3 = 12000 weights if its neural network

deep network = lots of convolution

recursive network architecture = make 3d into 2d 
and classify the result and then run into again and classify again 

3d-filters, videoes, time-laps
recursive neural networks - boundary detection and image labeling
it provides good starting point
