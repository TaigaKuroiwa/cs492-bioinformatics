Project 3 
histopathology will give categorization problem and we will do it on PC 
unfortunately no right wrong answer, so lot of creativity 
We will actually visit their class/lab
group project, actually 

Image processing
python imaging library = 
from PIL import Image//python code, its in anaconda 
https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/3.3.x/
Image.putpixel//simply changing the pixel, but maybe not 3d image 
Image.putdata//need to have the image arranged already 
Image.paste//puts into different image 

why is fast access to individual pixels hard?
it is simply not designed to easily access, but manipulate in different ways 
but it is ok to change the color per pixel 

a simple technique:
1.derivative of intensity -> must be the value of how much is changing in the intensity 
2.difference from the neighbors(average disperaty), multi-directional change 
3. making dark membranes darker 

the example, 
dark membrane darker + putting small line + putting big line 

color, rgb images, etc:
image.new("RGB", (512,512), "white")//the middle one is size, and last one is default color 
unfortunately image.new is not that quite simple 
basically it will double time because we are making 2 images 

vsscile detector project!
some cases vescile will block the detection,
need to know if its inside the circle <- is it just neighbours?
	what we could do is to define the frontier 
	think about the paint bucket on the painting tools 
should work by, 
1. take a pixel 
2.find is it vescile or not
basically looking for a small(?) circles 
you don't need to have a user interface, just do it 
find the edge and find the circumferance of the small circle 
mostlikely you will use only one image, not THE 3d images 

stack of images;
it is specifically not 3d 
array of images is basically will be list/stack of images 


Aug 31 

Multi-threading -> will not make the result easily determined
supposed to be super easy in Python 3

if we can find the edge, we would now curvature（湾曲、ひずみ）

vescile tend to be looking empty

image quality is always been an issue in image processing 

Artificial intelligence on machine learning essentials
http://www.geocities.co.jp/Technopolis/5893/machinelearning.html
present examples (need to know classifications) -> 
feature vector
supervised learning 
Training set = now everything and make them learn / test set= make sure how accurate machine is 
accuracy is just accuracy 
confusion matrix = the cancer detector's accuracy and actual % of patients 
get examples -> define feature vector -> get test set -> if suitable use it for future
j48 = tree 
Artificial neural nets = from node to node 
support vector machine = has its own graph, and add new dimension so that it will be easier divide samples 
						unimaginable amount of time required 
k-nearest neighbors algorithm = distant vectors from the feature vectors in the graph 
						if the data is irrelavant, it is not helpful at all-> most of them will be noise 

Graphical Neural Analyzer
