the image on reality is not always sliced perpendicular
therefore you will see the stacks in some respective angle

fiji 
import image sequence -> find the directory 
python image library apparently does not support 3d images or stacked images 
the stacked image may jump around -> can fix on the fiji 
	land stack slices
