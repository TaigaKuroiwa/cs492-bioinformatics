Cells
Eukaryotes have organelles = all the multiple cells are Eukaryotes(most likely), but could be single too 
Prokaryotes and Archaea don't 

Single-cell organisms

Common organelles
Nueleus - the most obvious part of the cell 
	-DNA is here, RNA is formed, mRNA is used to synthesize proteins in the ribosome
	-Protein = chains of amino acids, which usually transform or diverge 
	-結論プロテイン働きすぎマン
Ribosomes
	- not inside a membrane + protein synthesis 
	- protein factory, sorting dividing combining 
Mitochondria
	- singular is mitochondrian
Golgi apparatus
	- packages proteins in vesicles
	- you don't want to react proteins at random timing -> so you package them 
Vacuole
	- mostly a plant thing and its mostly water 
	- use pressure and push out the water in some cases 
Lysosome
	- breakdown biological molecules 
Chloroplast 
	- for photosynthesis
	
Membranes, more detail
Lipid bilayer = the outer lipids movearound on their side(they usually don't cahnge side)
	- water does not usually pass through 
	
Gates 
things on lipid bilayer 
Ion channel - for neural connections and such 
	- channels(proteins) that allows certain stuff
	
Metabolism 
Mitochondria is uses ATP 
fat and protein can be converted 
Rabbit Starvation = rabbit has too much proteins(much more than chickens) = fat starvation
start to fat first -> start to use protein 

Neurotransmitters
