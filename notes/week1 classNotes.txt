CS492 - bioinformatics Week1
Monday 3-5 will be our lab, from next week

bioinformatics are develop software stuff for biological data,
and simultaneously how computers could approach to the biology.
(small overlap exist in biology and CS)

computational biology, extremely similar with bioinformatics.
seems like terminology of those two are very messy
and many people tend to see things as similar

file genetic tree
tells how genetically we are similar, like homogenes and all the sorts
EX, is rabbit close to cat

genetic analysis,
duck is more closer to pelican or chickens?
actually many money is paid for genetic analysis
especially very important once it relates to pestiside or any medicine related stuff.

biologist tend to have different thought process
especially the "work" part of software tend to be hard for them
and in this class, we will study "biologist"

how to work across the fence = histopathology link

overview of image analysis in biology

overview of the rest of the field of bioinformatics

Need for bioinformatics
it tends to happen where bunch of data will help us have better techs
ex, gene sequences, images from microsope

CS hypothesis testing

How we will learning
it is expected to be more well-rounded

final and mid are mostlikely its based on our presentations
there will be question about the lab on each mid and final
so you must keep on track!!
basically it will be very heavy class focus exams

Presentation,
found the paper online and then present at the class

project
1. will make vesicle detector
2. histopath connection
3. find the cancer cell / genetic sequence comparison

labs
1. pilogenetic tree familarity
2. learn image processing
3. plan warm-up neuron counter
4. identifying stuff in EM images
5. outlining

in biology, its unlikely that you will understanding everything
mostlikely you will be leftout at some point

Genomes(ゲノム) and trees
	-ome:  The whole
	genome:  All the genes of an organism

Allele = like value?
https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/対立遺伝子
we can have 1 or more in the same gene

Phylogenetic tree　系統樹
what happens the genome be compared
https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/系統樹
recently used to check your ancestory

Trees(phylogenetic tree, Phylogeny, Evolutionary tree)
(we actually want to right it root up and down leaves, that is not biological way!)
leaf: extant species, generaly, could be extinct species
edge: descended
Internal node: hypothetical ancestor, but not have be found well at all
root: common hypothetical ancestor(just assuming, not sure atall)

binarytree unless knowledge is incomplete
two branches is a polytome(多分岐)
hard polytomy  = well known factor
soft polytomy = may know soon(may include ? mark)

subtree: cladistic classification 分岐学
non cladistic classification include reptiles because they aren't monophyletic 

Speciation: not generally observed, kind of nebulous（不明慮）
you can not speciate very well 

Cladograms, Additive trees, Ultrametric trees 
cladogram is just telling difference, 
additive tree shows distance of difference 
ultrametric tree has scale, but it may not be constant 

Unrooted tree 
its usually like shape of X, just simply no root 

Plesiomorphic: same as the ancestor 
apomorphic: derived state 
autopomorphic: particular one, aut = alone, unique to particular decendant 
synapomorphic: shared, shared by more than one decendant
Homology : state that is the same between two decendants because it came from shared ancestors 
however the ancestor is very vague term, 
Homoplasy: similarity that occurred independantly 


Distances
d(a,b) >= 0 (0 shouldn't be existing)
d(a,b) == d(b,a)
d(a,c) <= d(a,b) + d(b,c) (triangle inequality)
d(a,b) == 0 only if a == b 
some processes generate non-metric distance measures 

Ultrametric distances: 
additional criteria ->  d(a,b) <= max(d(a,c), d(b,c))
isosceles triangle 
assumes constante rate of change 

Clades and classification

Genes are duplicated inside organism 
Orthologous genes not been duplicated since the most recent common ancestor 
paralogues genes have 
entire genome must be used for comparison 

Alleles coalesce farther up the tree 
some value of gene could branch out in different direction 
Allele can branch out diffeently with the organism as designed 

Consensus tree 
by adding polytomies 
strick 
majority 
adams(retain similar subtrees)
check the consensus tree jpg image 

Recombination
imagining not a tree anymore = designing the organism from the combination of different gene 

Golden rice 
a rice that has beta carotene(ベータカロチン、人参にあるやつ)
simply regulations not allow to release it

Insect resistance in crops 
bacillus Thuringeiensis, bacterium that makes insecticide 

Taxonomic Ranks:
	Life
	Domain (Archaea, Bacteria, Eukarya, talk about viruses but not yet)
	Kingdom Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, Protista, Archaeabacteria, Bacteria)
		- Not monophyletic
	Phylum
		- Anamalia contains 35 of these
		- Examples:  Annelida, Anthropoda, Chordata
		- There are more divisions here than that
	Class (Mammalia, etc, not frequently discussed)
	Order (Primates, Lagomorphs, Carnivora, etc.), lots of additional levels
	Family (Leporidae, Phasianidae, Hominidae)
	Genus (Oryctolagus, Gallus, Homo)
	Species (Oryctolagus cuniculus, Gallus gallus domesticus (or Gallus gallus), Homo Sapiens)
