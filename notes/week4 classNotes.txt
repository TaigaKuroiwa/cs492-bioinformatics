Methamphetamines

Embryonic development: retina is brain tissue!（網膜）
actually observable brain tissue
has Photoreceptors are sensitive to light
	they don't photosynthesize
	just an neuron that interact with the light
	rods function in dim light(the development of eyes could be longterm)
	cones in bright light 
	
Entrainment
Circadian rhythms概日リズム
chronological matching to environmental events 

photosensitive ganglion cells circadian rhythm 
and reflexive brith-light response 
sensitive to blue lightfound in ganglionic layer 

approx 6million cones, 12million rods in human 
this is not the quantity nor ratio in other creatures

glutamate used as neurotransmitter = but not always


Retina neuron types:
	Rod
	Cone
	Bipolar(rod and cone, depending on connection)
		On and off 
		Types, retinal bipolar cells:elementary building blocks
	Amacrine 
		connected in a horizontal manner
		lots of types
		function poorly understood
	Horizontal cells
	Ganglion cells
		these have types too
	
Retina layers:
	layer of rods and cones
	outer nuclear layer
	outer plexiform layer
		we are interested in this now
	Inner nuclear layer
	inner plexiform layer
	ganglionic layer
	blood vessels
	
Muller glia, glia = glue 
	most common glial cell type in the retina
	
	
DSCAM(down syndrome cell adhesion molecule)
BAX(Bcl-2-associated X protein)
Case note: Guidelines for formatting Gene and Protein names

DSCAM Localization and Function at the Mouse Cone Synapes

Introduction 
Mechanism underlying development of retinal structure are laregely unexplored
Drosophila Dscam1
	some exons maybe excluded when mRNA is formed
	that allows an alternative interpretation
	record players
	many functions are similar anyway

DSCAM implicated in:
	Axon guidance
	self-avoidance = kind off spacing 
	organization of synpatic pairing 
	adhesion	
		-transmembrane domain
	
DSCAM may affect cone circuites
	conclusion -> it does
	questions:
		where is the DSCAM in the mouse retina?
		how about the macaque and ground squirrel
		what morphological differences do we see?
		
Materials and Methods
Animals:
	DSCAM 2J mice
		-4pair insertion that disrupts DSCAM
		-no detectable DSCAM produced
	DSCAM FD and DSCAM F mice 
		- Tissue-specific targeting regarding transmembrane domain
	Bax null
	Squirrel and Macaque were opportunistic
	
Tissue prep(confical microscope = takes out anything not focused, it has lazers that you can beam in particular place)
	Anethetized and purfused with PBS
	Eyes hemisected in PBS
	Fixed in PFT 4%
	30% sucrose overnight, then froze in cutting media
	sectioned to 10um (micrometers)
	stained, long list, of interest for duplicating results
	imaged with Plympus confocal
	
Tissue prep(TEM)
	same as above to PFA
	fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde, 2% formaldehyde overnight 
	PBS rinses
	0.1M cardylate rinses
	
Analysis techniques:
	voroni domain analysis
		- Figure6
		- area closer to that pedicle than any other 
	Density recovery profile
		-spacial density of points
	Nearest Neighbor
		- not the machine learning techniques
		- distance to closest neighbor 
		
Results: 
	GOOD!
	
	
Sep 14th 

Project description in brief
actual source code  
the actual source code + a report that explains how your solution works 
you can do with your group 

you can use any language you like -> go check the imaging libraries 
duedate oct 17th ish, by the next morning 
project 3 around dec5th, project 2 around november, project1 oct17ish 

you will have image and on xy(x) coordinate 
output in that vexel part of a vescicle or not? -> colored pictures 

on the report "how well" here means accuracy of your program 
data its on home/share/
