week6 classNotes

Found computers everywhere, discovered code
	non-coding regions
	stuff we don't understand can be important 
	"form follows funciton"

Genetics and politics, and curriculum
	How important are hypothetical ancestors?
	Form a theory to explain observations
		- when nothing contradicts it, we get attached
		- AES
		- EMDrive = microwave thruster, and its still can't explain with physics
	Things long ago hard to know about 
		- velociraptors(dinosaurs) and feathers
		- neandrathal example
	Chickens, artifical and natural selection and evolution
		- that says nothing about how or when life began
		- but it leads to a theory for origin of diversity
		- one that is wrapped in emotional entanglements(could be very personal)
		
Genetics, preparing to cover these
	And presentation tips for biology / bioinformatics papers
	
Reminders
	transgenic organisms = genese planted into it 
	genomics = looking at genomes as hole
	phenotype = 
	genotype = 
	gene 
	allele
	
Wikipeadia "introduction to genetics" maybe useful
	genetic determination
		= epigenetic inheritance 
		= learning from experiences
	Genese as a blueprint
	Genese as words
		starting at different spot and produce different protein
	

Not covered last time, but probablly should be covered
	inheritance
	recessive traits
	46 chromosomes in humans, in 23 pairs
	Hair example is kind of abnormal
	
Misconceptions about genetics, according to Wikipeadia
	Genetic Determinism
		- Epigenetic inheritance
	Single-gene control of phenotypes
	Genes as a blueprint
		- This is sort of true
		- I think the article is anti-oversimplification
	Genes as words
		- Again, anti-oversimplification
		
sometimes appropriate means of simplification
	anthromorphism
	for a machine: what does it do?
		- pointedly ignore how it does it
		- this should answer "why do you need it?"
	Use percise terms
		- only ok if communicating with experts = actually great shortcut
		
Presenting something complicated in detail:
	people will have trouble tracking this
	strategies to help:
		- review 
		- checkpoints
		- don't require recall of something complicated = often minute ish
		- don't require retention of new terms for long
		- always assume and use intelligence
		- spiral, with different examples
			sneak review in without causing hatred 
	your presentation will be long enough to make this useful
	conference talks by graduate students
		- the best defense is a good offense 
		
Let's talk about glowing transgenic fish!
	
Fluorescent proteins:
	bioluminescence
		- fluroscent proteins have a role in it
		- fluroscence requires eneregy input
		- flourescent tubes use UV 
	Green flourescent Proteing(gfp) from comb jelly
		- was put into C. Elegans
		- many articles make use of these
		- outside science: alba and ANDi, Glofish
		- article suggestion and comfort with GMO 
	
Studying gene expression
	Promotors 
	FP's are easy to see 

Ecology
	As a marker, as usual
	Obvious phenotype
	Example:  Which plants are transgenic?
	Non-destructive determination
	Neuteral markers
		- Does not reduce fitness
		- Edible!  Fluorescent feces
	Transgene zygosity
		- Homozygose:  Matching alleles
		- Heterozygous:  Non-matching alleles
			+ One will be dominant
		- Hemizygous:  Only one copy
		- Nullizygous:  Two loss-of-function alleles
			+ Also homozygous
		- Heterozygous canola plants exhibited lower fluorescence
			than homozygous plants
	
Monitor transgenic organisms
Environmental monitoring:  Detect toxins, show with FP
Spectrum analysis equipment
	Tractor-mounted?
Which FP is best?
	Quantum yield
	Exitation wavelength and noise
Custom colors
	Lasers can create particular wavelengths
	
Sep 28 

Gorilla Gorilla Gorilla
	Western Lowland Gorilla
	
It is totally fine run Fiji and use Weka and do the project 	

Lab results:
	Most solutions struggled with clustered vesicles
	Occasional membrane inclusion is NOT ok
	Promising results a lot of the time
	It'll depend on the features
		- You can add features yourself if you like

BLAST
	Basic Local Alignment search Tool
	Why local?
		- Regions of similarity
	Is it a tool or an algorithm?
		- Both...
	Find sequences that are close to a given sequence = find regions of similarity 
	Fast non-optimal algorithm
		- Why non-optimal?
	Often used for approximate sequence matching
	
Running BLAST
	Easier to run online
	It searches non-local data anyway
	Let's run it on DSCAM!

GeneBank

What if you find a badly-decomposed organism?
	If you can get DNA out of it to sequence, BLAST will work!
	Fossils, etc
	Mosquitos in amber?

The algorithm:
	Good alignments contain short lengths of exact matches
	Designed for fast search
	Words:  11 base pairs
	Can be used on proteins too!  Words of 3 amino acids
	Scoring
		- Scoring of pairs of words
		- Positive score for good substitutes or original
		- With proteins:  Many values
		- With DNA:  Generally 5 (identity) or -4
		- Tables
	Maximal Segment Pair (MSP)
		- Highest-scoring pair of identical length segments
		- When comparing sequences...
		- Sequence score is the sum of individual scores 
		- Longer sequence has higher potential score
	Low-complexity regions
		- Scoring will come later
	Find similar words
		- Using the scoring
	Words go in a search tree
	Scan for exact matches with search tree words
	Extend the exact matches to High Scoring Segment Pairs
	List all the HSPs with high enough score
	About done at this point!
	Evaluate significance of HSP score
		- Use statistics...
	Make HSPs into longer alignment
		- May score lower with longer alignment
	Show Sigh-Waterman local alignents

Variants:
	Gapped Blast (blast2)
	Parallel Blast
		- How could it be parallelized?
	Accellerated versions
		- FPGA, CUDA, MPI, and more

Alternatives:
	FASTA
	BLAT

Research using these
	Efflux-mediated heavy metal resistance in prokaryotes
	Eukaryotic zinc transporters and their regulation
