Note about goats
Gender in chicks
	Cromosomes
	As far as I know, no use of fluorescent proteins
	
Rabbit colors!
	They're different colors
Mendel square for Silver
	Allele from each parent
	Homozygous, Heterozygous, recessive, dominant
How about a bigger one?  Gene C
	This is an example in the Bio 181 textbook
But the complete picture is a little more complicated
	Human height...
A more complete example!
	I have some rabbits
	Rabbit color genes at DebMark and my examples

Notes (reminder for me):
	I don't know Ariel's genotype except for C
		- Caprica's genotype could have been different
	Ebenezer speculation
		- Hybrid vigor, or maybe temperment
	Do Dinah and Belle have an albino allele?
		- I'll never know!
		- Could find out...
	Coloration and cold and not-albios	

BLAST uses
Using amino acid sequence instead of DNA
	Study the product instead of the description?
	Non-coding regions in DNA
		- Not "junk"
	Primers in DNA
		- A short strand, starting point for synthesis
		- Required for replication
	Daphnia	
	Leigh 
		- Primer
		- Philgenetic tree reconstruction for a gene
	Protein sequences compared to gene sequences

How to read a paper

How does DNA work anyway?
	DeoxyriboNuclease Acid
	RNA = RiboNuclease Acid
	Strand of nucleotides
		- Two strands, running opposite directions
		- Base pair = two nucleotides
			+ Thymine and Adenine, Cytosine and Guanine
			+ Pairing due to length in spiral
			+ This is NOT the pairing for different genes
		- 3' and 5' ends
		- Organization:  Genes, Chromosomes
			+ Chromosomes are paired (inheritance)
			+ During reproduction:  Chromosomes are un-paired
			+ Homozygous, Heterozygous, dominant, recessive
		
		- Gene is at a locus on a chromosome
		- Allele is a possible sequence for a gene
			+ Some genes have many alleles, some have two, some have one
			+ What happens if there's an invalid allele?  Death usually.
		- GeneBank then:  Includes genomes of many organisms
			+ But they're all different
		
	In a Cell:
		- DNA is held in the nucleus
		- Complete genome in nucleus!  But only some parts used.
		- mRNA is formed in the nucleus
			+ Various processes control how exactly
			+ Protein-coding sequences 
		- Amino acid sequences are formed from mRNA in the RER
			by ribosomes (rough vs. smooth ER)
		- Golgi apparatus packages proteins, modifies some proteins by adding sugars
		- Smooth endoplasmic reticulum does metabolism stuff, lipid synthesis, 
					sorting, depends on type of cell
	Cell Division:
		- DNA is copied, in multiple places at once
		- Pairing makes this possible
		- Separate strand, DNA polymerase joins appropriate bases to half-strands
		- Primer required to start
		- This process is not prone to frequent errors
	
Terms I might or might not have forgot:
	Recombinant DNA:  Brings together multiple sources
		- Tree becomes a graph
		- Leads to transgenic organisms
		- Viruses do that too sometimes...
	genome
	pedegree
	hybrid
	

Brief history:
	Mendel:  Late 1866
	DNA might be involved:  40's
	DNA spiral conceived:  1953
	Regulation of gene expression:  60's
	Genetic engineering:  70's (controlled gene expression)
	Sequencing:  90's
	Widespread use in everything:  2000 to now
	Compare/Contrast to progression in CS

maybe want to find a tool that they've used to demonstrate the presentation
