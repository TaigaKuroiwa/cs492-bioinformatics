write up the test question 
Project update:  Many people are working on it
	Library use is OK
	Deadline:  Are we going to make it?

Presentation scheduling

Leigh and lab, sometime
	Today we'll learn to outline
	You won't like vesicles anymore
	At some point in the future, you'll be judged on speed!
	The good computers aren't here...

A brief history of genetic modification:
	Direct modification of an organism's genome
		- Indirect modification:  Breeding, etc
		- This started a long time ago
	Grafting?
		- Fruit trees are often done this way
		- And roses
		- Wikipedia:  Natural form of genetic engineering
		- Not usually what people mean...
	Not a very precise term
		- For example:  Call transgenic organisms transgenic
	Reminder:  Gene vs. Allele
		- So you transplant an allele of a gene
	X-rays have been used to speed plant mutation

Genetics:
	Named in 1905
	Needed for genetic engineering

Modifying organisms:
	First recombinant lab DNA:  SV40 virus and lambda virus
	Next:  Adding resistance to Kanamycin to bacteria
	1973:  Transgenic mouse!  SV40 in mouse DNA
		- Jaenisch was expecting tumors
		- Did not pass on allele
		- 1981:  DNA in mouse that passes on
	1983:  Genetically modified tobacco
		- Survives lethal levels of antibiotic

Regulation:
	Always follows any technology...drones...
	What about ecosystems?
		- New Zealand and rabbits
		- Could that happen elsewhere?

Research uses:
	1984:  Mice that develop cancer
		- And various knockout mice, starting in 1989
		- DSCAM and BAX knockouts are great
	1992:  Knock out tumor suppression mechanisms
	2003:  Knockout rats (they were harder)
	microRNA discovered in 1993
	Now:  Used all the time for many purposes

Commercial use:
	1982:  Human insulin for sale
		- It was produced starting in 1978
		- Back when cars had carborators and no computers
	1987:  ice-minus straing of P. Syringae to protect from frost
		- On strawberries and potatoes
		- Fields attacked by activists
	1986:  GMO tobacco plants resistant to herbicides
	1987:  GMO tobacco plants resistant to insects
		- They produce insecticital proteins
	1994:  Flavr Savr tomato with long shelf life
	Also 1994:  Commercial use of tabacco plants (took a while...)
	Use expanded rapidly after that
	2013:  Monsanto bigwigs awarded World Food Prize

Rabbits and GMO alfalfa:
	Rise and shine rabbitry opinion:
		- Roundup use lowers nutritional content
		- Changes in goats fed GMO soy
			+ DNA from feed blood, organs, etc
			+ Higher levels of lactate dehydrogenase (is that bad?)
		- Anecdotal evidence that GMO pellets make rabbits less healthy
		- Rabbit enzyme levels change with GMO soy
			+ Why feed rabbits soy?
		- A German farmer lost 65 cows after feeding GMO corn
	How relevant is the above?
		- Molasses in pellets
	Things come together
