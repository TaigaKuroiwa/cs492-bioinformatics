Kyle = lip plasm 
approximate string matching problem
find the smallest edit distance 
usually three, insertion + substitution + ???, 
hamming distance 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance


Janey = 3D bioprinting system to produce human-scale tissue constructs with structual integrity
not much donor is the reality - we must make it 
this paper is ear because of difficulty 
historically - not 3d _ no grow cartilage and blood vessels = much failiure 

Jetting 
pros = produces picoliter scale drops with in printing 20-100myu-m

Extrusion
more 3d stable + high concentration of hydrogels such as alginate, fibrin and pluronic 

Laswer induced forward transwer
print cells in relatively small constructs 
cons - low flow rate

Integrated tissue-organ printer 
traditional 3d printer ish 
it uses human mice cells 

how they achieved 
structural integrity in a liquid forms 
able to use different types of materials 
down to 2micrometers 
microchannels

medical imaging (mri) -> 3d cad model -> visualized motion program 
-> 3d printing ->3d bioprinted tissue product 

composite hydrogel 
gelatin 
fibrinogen 
Hydraharonic acid 
glycerol mixed into DMEM 
viability was very close to 100%

Mandible bone reconstruction 

Calvarial bone reconstruction 
maturation of bioprinted bone 
blood vessel going through + thickness of bone increased within 5 months

Ear cartilage reconstruction 


An Introduction to Biometric Recognition - Amjad 

Issues 
performance and type
acceptability by public
circumvention 

Biometrics system 
recogniton system that operates acquirng biometric data 

Verification mode = validates a person's identity by comparing the captured biometric data 
Identification mode = the system recognizes an individual by searching the templates of all the users 

DNA, ear, face, vein inframed thermogram, fingerprint, gait(behavior analysis), 
hand finger geometry, Iris, keystroke, signature 

application of biometrics 
commercial = atm, 
government = national ID  
forensic 

disadvantage 
negative recognition 


Iris Recognition - Michael 
it was thought that iris will not change -> recent research found that some odd interaction will change iris 
How much info will you need to recognize iris. 
Infrared light and odd camera and normal camera 
easily accessible + convenient + fast and secure + distinctive (half a second)
unless someone could get good image of eyes 
consideration of selfie images = iris on public
it skins the ridges of center of eye（瞳）
it must be straight on = need good orientation 

image acquisation, iris location and pre-processing = horizontal images of wave and hills and vallies 
iris texture feature extraction and signature encoding 
iris signature matching for recognition or verification 

Daugman's Alogrithm = not accurate but very fast 
Hamming distance -> what percentage differnce acceptance to verify the person 

Hardware desing 
offline vs online 
they only needed 12bits of data for each packet 

300 irises + 1200 times of matching = 98.3% verification + 9.2% rejection rate 
much noise in wireless transmittion

Cut and paste manufacture of multiparametric epidermal sensors - Kent 
very thin electric cerquitry 
superthin - move and strecth - will not get damaged easily 
pretty much one time use = like a temporary tatoo 

vaccum deposition of films - use chamber of gold and vaccume will sucks into skin 
photolithorgraphy = inprint pattern they want 
wet and dry etching = bombar material with irons and keep it there 
transfer - printing = depth coding 

Limitations
photolithorgraphy = very rigid and not used a lot 
high cost + need clean rooms 
high amount of man power required 

cut and paste 
doesnt use vacuum deposition 
doesn't use photolithography patterning 
less than 10 min 

they use aluminum(not preferred but cheap) or gold 
thin as 9 nano meters 
breathing + hydration humidity + eye closing/opening + muscle + pumps
